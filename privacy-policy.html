                circumstances and purposes of processing as well as the different probability of occurrence and severity of the risk for

                protection level corresponding to the EU (e.g. for the USA through the "Privacy Shield") or compliance with officially 
                recognized special contractual obligations (so-called "standard contractual clauses").

            <p>
                We maintain an online presence within social networks and platforms in order to be able to communicate with the customers,

            <h4>Embodiment of third party services and content</h4>
            <p>
                We use content or service offers from third-party providers within our online offer based on our legitimate interests 
                (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 
                Para. 1 lit). Integrate services such as videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as “content”). <br><br>
                This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the user, since 
                they would not be able to send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore 
                required to display this content. We strive to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address 
                to deliver the content. Third-party providers can also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as 
                “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. The “pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as 
                visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information can also be stored in cookies on the 
                user's device and contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, 
                referring websites, visiting time and other information about the use of our online offer, as well as being 
                linked to such information from other sources.

                CA 94043, USA. The processed data may include, in particular, the users' IP addresses and location data, which, 
                however, are not collected without their consent (usually in the context of the settings of their mobile devices). 
                The data can be processed in the USA. Data protection declaration:
