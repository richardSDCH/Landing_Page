                    <h3>Make meaningful networking</h3>
                    <p>Like you do in a social network, your firm will find relevant information on potential trade partners 
                        and digitally interact with them, building trust.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Save time and avoid misunderstandings</h3>
                    <p>Instead of negotiating a deal through countless e-mails, phone calls or whatsapp messages, 
                        you can agree on all the trade terms through a single and intuitive interface, updated automatically 
                        each time that a party changes a term.</p>

                    <h3>Show your performance</h3>
                    <p>Transparency and sustainability across supply chains is becoming increasingly important. 
                        In BlackGull, you will keep a fully auditable track record of your trade operations, 
                        which can be made accessible to third parties.</p>

                <div class="benefit-action">
                    <h3>Grow and conquer new territories</h3>
                    <p>We understand that you aspire for more. More markets for your exports; more options of raw materials 
                        or semi-manufactured products. BlackGull connects you with those.</p>

                    <h3>Increase access to finance and insurance</h3>
                    <p>Trade finance and trade insurance are difficult to access for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs); the smaller, the harder. 
                        The auditable track record of your trade operations will show your true level of credit and risk.</p>

                    <p>While large companies work with sophisticated enterprise software like ERP and SCM, that is usually too expensive for MSMEs. 
                        BlackGull will be free for basic functions, offering affordable packages for firms of various sizes and needs.</p>

                    <h3>Take advantage of a digital ID</h3>
                    <p>BlackGull will provide your firm with a cryptographic digital identity, based on the R3 Corda blockchain platform. 
                        This will allow it to seamlessly interact in increasingly digital trade ecosystems.</p>

                    <h3>Integrate into digital global value chains</h3>
                    <p>COVID-19 has accelerated digitalization of global value chains (GVCs) to levels no one expected. 
                        Our digital tool will help your firm to keep pace with and integrate into GVCs.</p>

                    <h3>Control your trade data</h3>
                    <p>Data is being called the “new oil”. BlackGull will enable your firm to keep control of the data generated as a result of its trade activity. 
                        This data will be owned and taken advantage of by your firm, not by others that pay nothing for it.</p>

            <div id="background">
                <p>BlackGull was born in Sabadell, a small city in the skirts of Barcelona, out of a concern for the struggles that small companies
                    from the area were facing to get involved in international trade, specially after the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Since then,
                     we have been discussing our vision and testing our product with small firms from Europe, Latin America and Africa.
                      The project has received support from the Sabadell Chamber of Commerce and from R3 Venture Development.
                   <br><br>
                   At the beginning of 2021, we successfully graduated as one of the Batch VI startups in the F10 Fintech Incubator program in Zurich. 
                   Currently, our startup is a fellow of the Impact Factory program (Duisburg), and has its offices in the Digital Hub Logistics Hamburg, 
                   part of the De Hub ecosystem initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
