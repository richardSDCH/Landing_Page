                    <h3>Make meaningful networking</h3>
                    <p>Like you do in a social network, your firm will find relevant information on potential trade partners 
                        and digitally interact with them, building trust.</p>

                    <h3>Save time and avoid misunderstandings</h3>
                    <p>Instead of negotiating a deal through countless e-mails, phone calls or whatsapp messages, 
                        you can agree on all the trade terms through a single and intuitive interface, updated automatically 
                        each time that a party changes a term.</p>

                    <h3>Grow and conquer new territories</h3>
                    <p>We understand that you aspire for more. More markets for your exports; more sources 
                        of raw materials or semi-manufactured products. Tradeledge connects you with those.</p>

                        the smaller, the harder. With Tradeledge, you’ll keep an auditable track record of your trade operations that will show 
                        your true level of creditworthiness and risk, making your life easier with banks, insurance companies, etc.</p>

                    <p>While large companies work with sophisticated enterprise software like ERP and SCM, that is usually too expensive for MSMEs. 
                        Tradeledge will offer affordable packages for firms of various sizes and needs, with a free entry subscription.</p>
